<h1>Grass Roots</h1><p>
  
I’ve got somewhere stupid
to be.
So I have to go,
excuse me.

To farewell—
I’ve lost friends,
possibly possible lovers,
a cash gift returned.

But I do it again.

What’s the difference
between leaving and staying?
What’s the difference
between losing and being blue?
What’s between
the lawn and the dirt?

I don’t really fucking
know 
much about it.

But—there are
roly-polys and worms.
And grass roots.

(If they’re the
golf-course-steroid-sanitized
kind that
soak up water
  
like some 
perpetually
dried sponge

just to be
greener than the rest—
and flaunt.)

Bugs still crawl and creep,
but—
it ain’t the same
  
as when green ain’t lime
and don’t distract me
from cloudless sky:

blue.
No rain.
No chance.
For years.
(Four years?)

Forget me
like I hope 
to forget
HGH grass.

Don’t gift me goodbyes.
Don’t send me letters.
Don’t expel an utter.

But—
I’ll take a farewell kiss,
‘cause,
  
I’m going somewhere stupid again.
