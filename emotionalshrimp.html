    <h1>scabs</h1>

    <p>

The little shrimp  

set out  

on a dare  

to find its fate  

in seaweed hair.  

She swam  

down  

and down  

and down  

until she was…  


lost as fuck.  
      

A whale swam and  

sucked—  

and in went little shrimp  

through elongated tusks,  

into a dark cave mouth,  

its tongue rough and brown.  
      

Upon reeking muscle  

sat a fish,  

sorting through  

file cabinets,  

each drawer spilling:  

one held glasses,  

another—bowls,  

another—forks.  
      

The bottom drawer—  

something dark red,  

dry and crusty:  

scabs.  
      

The fish that filed  

seemed familiar,  

but the shrimp  

couldn’t place her.  
      

Filing fish swam around,  

side-eyeing the child.  

Seeing her made her…  

want to go back to filing scabs.  
      

But the shrimp  

couldn’t contain  

the need to ask:  

“Are you okay?”  
      

To which the fish  

flared her gills,  

filtered salt solution,  

and said,  

“Not really.”  


Little shrimp  

pried,  

“What’s wrong?”  
      

Filing fish let out a snarl—  

“Beat it, kid. Enjoy yourself.  

Life’s a little bit  

of this and that—  

scabs and bowls  

that you never know  

exactly what to do with.”
